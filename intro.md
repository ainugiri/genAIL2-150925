AI:
Artificial - Man made
Intelligence: The ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills. 
Knowledge - Information, understanding, or skill that you get from experience or education.

System: ability to learn and apply knowledge
AI System: System that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the information they collect.

making system / machines think, learn, and act like humans.

Before 1956
 ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) - 1945
 UNIVAC (Universal Automatic Computer) - 1951
 for calculation, 
 Powerful in calculation and data processing

 1956 : 
    Dartmouth Conference - Birth of AI as a field
    simulation of human intelligence(reasoning, learning, problem-solving)

AI Application
    Knowledge Representation
    Symbolic / Rule Based Systems

    used - GOFAI 
    symbols, logic, hand coded rules -> Knowledge Base

    if cond_A and cond_B then action_C
    if cond_A or cond_B then action_D


when to choose 
    finite set of rules
    well defined problem
    single input -> single outplut
    
    MYCIN:
    - DIAGOSTIC system for identifying bacteria causing severe infections
    INPUT - Symptoms, patient history
    output - Diagnosis, treatment recommendation



Rule Based system:
   if less complexity & finite set of rules, then we can use rule based system
   chatbot - complex - multiple scenarios - not suitable for rule based system

Drawbacks:
- multiple rules for same condition
- Conflicting rules
- multiple output for single input. 


Rule Based System : if - else - NO LEARNING 


AI - Learn, knowledge, apply, perform tasks
