ML:
make the system to learn from data 
understand patterns from data
apply the learned patterns to make predictions on new data


Types of ML:
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning
4. Semi-Supervised Learning
5. Self-Supervised Learning


1. Supervised Learning:
if the system learn from labeled data
labelled data - input data with corresponding output labels

regression: prdedict continuous value output
    predict house price w.r.t features
    predict car price w.r.t features
    predict temperature w.r.t features

    a. linear regression (if your tries to create a linear model a line, plane, hyperplane)
    b. logistic regression (if your tries to create a logistic model - curve)
    c. polynomial regression (if your tries to create a polynomial model - curve with multiple bends)
    d. decision tree regression (if your tries to create a tree based model - multiple branches)
    e. random forest regression (if your tries to create multiple tree based model - multiple branches)
    f. support vector regression (if your tries to create a hyperplane based model - multiple dimensions)

classification : identify the group. w.r.t input data
    w.r.t mark -> Grade A, B, C, D
    mail -> Spam / Not Spam
    size of flower sepal, petal -> typeA , TypeB, TypeC
